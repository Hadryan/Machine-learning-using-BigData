        What is BLOB
            A BLOB (large binary object) is a MySQL data type which can be used to 
            store binary data. We can convert our files and images into binary data 
            in Python and store it in MySQL table using BLOB.
            Note: To insert file or image into MySQL table we need to create a column 
            which has a BLOB as a type. MySQL has the following four BLOB types. Each 
            holds a variable amount of data.
            
            a. TINYBLOB
            b. BLOB
            c. MEDIUMBLOB
            d. LONGBLOB
